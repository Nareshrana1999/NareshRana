### Mobile:
- On-screen directional buttons for movement
- Tap to jump

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crossy-road-3d.git
   cd crossy-road-3d
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser

Or simply open the `index.html` file directly in your browser.

## Technologies Used

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) - 3D library for JavaScript
- HTML5 & CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- WebGL for hardware-accelerated 3D graphics

## Game Mechanics

### Lanes
- **Grass Lanes**: Safe zones where you can move freely
- **Road Lanes**: Watch out for moving vehicles
- **River Lanes**: Cross carefully using logs or platforms

### Scoring
- +10 points for each lane crossed
- Bonus points for collecting items (coming soon!)

### Lives
You start with 3 lives. Running into obstacles will cost you a life. Game ends when all lives are lost.

## Development

### Project Structure
- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `style.css` - Styling for the game UI
- `script.js` - Main game logic and 3D rendering

### Running Locally
1. Start a local server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
2. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

### Future Improvements
- Add sound effects and background music
- Implement different characters
- Add power-ups and collectibles
- Create different environments
- Add day/night cycle
